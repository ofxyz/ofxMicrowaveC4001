=================

This is the a port of [DFRobot_C4001](https://github.com/cdjq/DFRobot_C4001) for reading data from the Df Robot C4001 sensor.
Originally written for an Arduino now as addon for OpenFrameworks.

> Core code for the sensor has been moved to [ofxGPIO](https://github.com/ofxyz/ofxGPIO). This addon excludes the GPIO library when not on a Raspberry and implements a fake sensor for prototyping needs.
